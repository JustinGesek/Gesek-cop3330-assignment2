//Create a program that picks a winner for a contest or prize drawing. Prompt for names of contestants until the user leaves the entry blank. Then randomly select a winner.
//
//Example Output
//Enter a name: Homer
//Enter a name: Bart
//Enter a name: Maggie
//Enter a name: Lisa
//Enter a name: Moe
//Enter a name:
//The winner is... Maggie.
//Constraints
//Use a loop to capture user input into an array.
//Use a random number generator to pluck a value from the array.
//Donâ€™t include a blank entry in the array.
//Some languages require that you define the length of the array ahead of time. You may need to find another data structure, like an ArrayList.
