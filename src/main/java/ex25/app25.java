//A very weak password contains only numbers and is fewer than eight characters.
//A weak password contains only letters and is fewer than eight characters.
//A strong password contains letters and at least one number and is at least eight characters.
//A very strong password contains letters, numbers, and special characters and is at least eight characters.
//Example Output
//The password '12345' is a very weak password.
//The password 'abcdef' is a weak password.
//The password 'abc123xyz' is a strong password.
//The password '1337h@xor!' is a very strong password.
//Constraints
//Create a passwordValidator function that takes in the password as its argument and returns a value you can evaluate to determine the password strength. Do not have the function return a stringâ€”you may need to support multiple languages in the future.
//Use a single output statement.
